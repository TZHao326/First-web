            My dream for now is simple and short-term. By joining this program and becoming part of DevSoc, I hope to work on real projects, learn practical web development skills, and explore new technologies. Through this experience, I want to grow step by step, gain confidence in building websites, and lay the foundation for bigger goals in the future.
