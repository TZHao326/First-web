            My name is Tian, I am currently a first-year CS student in my third term. 
            This website is my very first personal project, 
            and it has given me a great introduction to web development and design.
            I am excited to join this DevSoc to learn and collaborate with like-minded peers. 
            I hope to participate in real projects with everyone, not only to improve my technical skills but also to contribute to interesting and meaningful team work. 
            I believe that with the guidance and support of the club members, I can continue to grow and make valuable contributions.</p>
